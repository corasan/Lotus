# About

Built with React Native and Firebase.

Community where people can talk about their problems anonymously and get positive feedback from others who have gone through the same things. The objective is to give advice, encourage and support people who sometimes feel more comfortable talking to a stranger, which happens a lot. I want this project to have positive impact on people and spread positivity.

**Note: This project is currently in development, Lotus is a "codename" or temporal name of this project.**
